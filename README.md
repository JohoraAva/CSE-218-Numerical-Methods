# CSE-218-Numerical-Methods

Welcome to the Numerical Methods course repository for CSE-218. This repository contains course materials, code examples, offlines and onlines  related to the study of numerical methods.


## Introduction

This course introduces students to various numerical methods and techniques used for solving mathematical problems and analyzing data. The focus is on understanding the algorithms, implementing them in code, and applying them to real-world problems.

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to:

1. Analyze numerical method formulations for different mathematical and engineering problems.
2. Apply numerical methods to find solutions of mathematical problems.
3. Write computer programs to implement numerical methods in Python.
4. Analyze and evaluate the accuracy of numerical method solutions.
